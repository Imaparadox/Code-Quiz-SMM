## Description 
Click the start button to begin the quiz. Once the game starts a timer will countdown from 75 seconds and the first question will appear. Select an answer to continue to the next question. Bear in mind that wrong answers will subtract 10 seconds from the timer. When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over. The user can then click the "High Scores" button to enter their initials and save their score.
